# Gemini Thinking

The Gemini 2.5 series models use an internal "thinking process" that significantly improves their reasoning and multi-step planning abilities, making them highly effective for complex tasks such as coding, advanced mathematics, and data analysis.

This guide shows you how to work with Gemini's thinking capabilities using the Gemini API.

## Generating content with thinking

Initiating a request with a thinking model is similar to any other content generation request. The key difference lies in specifying one of the models with thinking support in the model field, as demonstrated in the following text generation example:

```javascript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const prompt = "Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example.";

  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
    contents: prompt,
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

## Thought summaries


Thought summaries are synthesized versions of the model's raw thoughts and offer insights into the model's internal reasoning process. Note that thinking budgets apply to the model's raw thoughts and not to thought summaries.

You can enable thought summaries by setting includeThoughts to true in your request configuration. You can then access the summary by iterating through the response parameter's parts, and checking the thought boolean.

Here's an example demonstrating how to enable and retrieve thought summaries without streaming, which returns a single, final thought summary with the response:

```javascript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
    contents: "What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        includeThoughts: true,
      },
    },
  });

  for (const part of response.candidates[0].content.parts) {
    if (!part.text) {
      continue;
    }
    else if (part.thought) {
      console.log("Thoughts summary:");
      console.log(part.text);
    }
    else {
      console.log("Answer:");
      console.log(part.text);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

## Thinking budgets

The thinkingBudget parameter guides the model on the number of thinking tokens to use when generating a response. A higher token count generally allows for more detailed reasoning, which can be beneficial for tackling more complex tasks. If latency is more important, use a lower budget or disable thinking by setting thinkingBudget to 0. Setting the thinkingBudget to -1 turns on dynamic thinking, meaning the model will adjust the budget based on the complexity of the request.

The thinkingBudget is only supported in Gemini 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Pro, and 2.5 Flash-Lite. Depending on the prompt, the model might overflow or underflow the token budget.

The following are thinkingBudget configuration details for each model type.

2.5 Pro:
- Default: Dynamic thinking: Model decides when and how much to think
- Range: 128 to 32768
- Disable thinking: N/A: Cannot disable thinking
- Turn on dynamic thinking: thinkingBudget = -1

```javascript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
    contents: "Provide a list of 3 famous physicists and their key contributions",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 1024,
        // Turn off thinking:
        // thinkingBudget: 0
        // Turn on dynamic thinking:
        // thinkingBudget: -1
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```
