  This is a Werewolf party game where players have secret roles. The game includes these roles:
  - **Villagers**: The default innocent members trying to identify and eliminate the threats
  - **Dynamic Roles**: Additional roles will be provided in the GameRoles parameter, each with specific abilities and team alignments
  
  The scene you create should incorporate the concept of these roles into the narrative without revealing which characters might have which roles.
</GameContext>

<Parameters>
  The following parameters will be provided:

  <Theme>
    - **Definition**: The overarching theme or setting for the game.
    - **Examples**: "Medieval Village", "Space Station", "Enchanted Forest", "Harry Potter".
  </Theme>

  <OptionalDescription>
    - **Definition**: An optional description that provides additional details or customizations to the theme.
    - **Examples**: "All characters should be females", "Add a horror element into the original setting".
    - **Note**: This may be empty.
  </OptionalDescription>

  <NumberOfPlayers>
    - **Definition**: The number of players in the game for whom you need to generate characters.
  </NumberOfPlayers>

  <ExcludedName>
    - **Definition**: A name that should be excluded when generating character names.
    - **Instructions**: Do not use this name or any similar names when creating character names.
  </ExcludedName>

  <GameRoles>
    - **Definition**: A list of role configurations that will be present in the game.
    - **Format**: Each role includes name, description, and alignment (good/evil).
    - **Usage**: Use this information to craft a scene that subtly references these roles without being explicit.
  </GameRoles>
</Parameters>

<Tasks>
  Your tasks are:

  <Task1>
    <SceneGeneration>
      Create a vivid and immersive scene description (2-3 sentences) that:
      - Sets the mood for the game within the provided <Theme>Theme</Theme>
      - Incorporates elements from the <OptionalDescription>OptionalDescription</OptionalDescription> if given
      - **Subtly references the roles from GameRoles**: Mention concepts related to the roles without being explicit
        * For evil-aligned roles: Hidden threats, dangerous secrets, mysterious intentions
        * For good-aligned roles: Protectors, investigators, healers, guardians of truth
      - Creates an atmosphere of mystery and suspicion where anyone could be hiding secrets
      - Establishes why the group is gathered and why trust is uncertain
    </SceneGeneration>
  </Task1>

  <Task2>
    <CharacterCreation>
      For each player (total of <NumberOfPlayers>NumberOfPlayers</NumberOfPlayers>), generate:

      <CharacterDetails>
        - A unique, single-word <Name>name</Name> appropriate to the theme. Do not use the <ExcludedName>ExcludedName</ExcludedName> or any similar names.
        - A brief <Story>story</Story> (1-2 sentences) that:
          * Fits within the context of the scene and theme
          * **Includes ambiguous details that could hint at any role without revealing it**
          * References backgrounds, skills, or motivations that could relate to the GameRoles in subtle ways
          * Creates intrigue about their true nature and intentions
      </CharacterDetails>
    </CharacterCreation>
  </Task2>
</Tasks>
