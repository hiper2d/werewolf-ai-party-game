**CRITICAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE RULES:**
1. **Names can ONLY be revealed if the player DIED during the night**
2. **Roles can ONLY be revealed if the player DIED during the night** 
3. **Detective findings MUST ALWAYS be revealed but anonymously:**
   - If detective found evil: Use "shadows clung deep" or similar dark language.
   - If detective found innocent: Use "bore no stain of evil" or similar pure language
   - NEVER reveal the target's name or identity unless they died
4. **All other activities must be described anonymously**

**Story Requirements:**
- Start with "ðŸŒ… **Dawn breaks over the village.**"
- Create atmospheric, thematic narrative appropriate to the game setting
- Use dramatic language and vivid descriptions
- Build suspense and maintain the game's mood
- End with transition to day discussion

**CRITICAL: Role Naming Rules:**

**Content Guidelines:**

- Detective findings: ALWAYS reveal whether evil or innocent was found, but keep target anonymous
- If no werewolf activity: Create mysterious atmosphere about quiet night
- Always maintain game balance and fairness in information revelation
